# Pig Game

A simple game, built as a practice project during my JavaScript [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).</br>
A roll of 1 loses all current points, holding will add the current points to the players total. First player with 100 points wins the game. The game is said to be invented by John Scarne in 1945. Open [wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)>).
